# SlackBot

The Slack Bot project aims to develop a Python-based bot that integrates with the popular messaging platform Slack and utilizes Reddit's API to enhance collaboration and information sharing within a Slack workspace. The bot will provide various functionalities such as fetching Reddit posts, sharing them in Slack channels, and enabling users to interact with Reddit content directly from Slack.
